Last week I started using Logseq for notetaking, before that I was using
Obsidian and before that I was using Notion. At the same time I started
learning Bevy, a ECS based engine for the Rust programming language.

They have one thing in common though, both of them forbid traditional
hierarchies for what they do. Logseq doesn't use directories for structure and
Bevy uses an ECS which is a different way of thinking about data and data
belonging to something.
