## About me

Hi! My name is __Gabriel Schneider__ and I study Computer Engineering at __[CIn](https://www3.cin.ufpe.br/en/) - UFPE__.  

My first experience with programming was in my school's robotics team when I was about 12. To this day, I remember how amazed I was when I discovered that I could increment variables, that I could name variables any way I wanted to like `int VaquinhaVoando;`, and that  I could write functions that do anything and return anything! 
I felt like I had the tools to make anything.
That experience kindled a flame that has never ceased but grown larger.

 At that time Flash games were pretty popular and I used to spend a lot of time in websites like [newgrounds](newgrounds.com) and [clickjogos](clickjogos.com.br). I learnt Flash (and it's language _ActionScript_) watching youtube tutorials and made a lot of animations, games and school assignments with it. And I remember when HTML5 launched and everybody was talking about how it would kill Flash.

After some time, while procrastinating on Youtube I discovered [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) and [carykh](https://www.youtube.com/user/carykh). They used a tool called Processing, with is designed to be like Arduino, but for Computer Graphics, it was so amazing! Fast forward to 2017, a friend told me about a workshop at [Porto Digital](https://www.portodigital.org/home).

I my current interests are Programming Languages, Compilers, Computer Graphics, [Gamedev](https://gbrls.itch.io/), and Competitive Programming.

# Tools
- This website was build using Hugo.
- My personal workstation runs Fedora Workstation 35.
- I mostly use Neovim as my IDE and CLion and VSCode when needed.
- Rust is my favourive language by far and I try to use it as much as possible.
- In my shell I use `fzf` a lot and my own tool [`pplaces`](https://github.com/gbrls/pplaces).
