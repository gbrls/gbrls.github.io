            <h2>A bit of background</h2>
          </div>
          <p>I started programming to make simple webpages and <span class="text-red"><code>Flash</code></span> games. To me it was about interacting with those systems, adding automation to them. Not long after that I started coding robots with <span class="text-red"><code>Arduino</code></span> and it was still just that, automating turning on a led, reading a value, writing something to a terminal, etc.</p>
          <p>It started to change when I discovered [The Coding Train]( <span class="text-blue"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain">https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain</a></span> ), through that I started to see, actually <em>see</em> how complex and amazing could be the things you did with code. It was then that I started to get concerned with abstractions, my code grew bigger and everything was so messy! I needed some help. Processing is <em>based</em> on <span class="text-red"><code>Java</code></span> which means the tools that I used to handle that complexity were Functions, Classes and Methods, it was actually fun.</p>
          <p>At the same time, I was part of a team making <span class="text-red"><code>Arduino</code></span> robots to compete. I quickly applied the tools that I learnt with Processing to <span class="text-red"><code>Arduino</code></span> , afterall they’re similar. I had no notion of state machines and agents, so the code was a mess and it didn’t work well. But, you know, all was good, I felt in control of the code, still very fun.</p>
          <p>During that time I met with some people that blew my mind my showing me how <em>“real programmign”</em> was like with <span class="text-red"><code>C#</code></span> and machine learning. I felt like I needed to learn some real programming… and I wanted to code my own <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>. I searched online, Dwarf Fortress was made in <span class="text-red"><code>C++</code></span> , <span class="text-red"><code>Arduino</code></span> was <em>based</em> on <span class="text-red"><code>C++</code></span> so it shouldn’t be that hard, right? Right?? Well, I printed a <span class="text-red"><code>C++</code></span> book, <em>Jumping into <span class="text-red"><code>C++</code></span></em> and ate it; it taught the basics of pointers, structs, methods, classes and templates, it’s a nice book.</p>
          <div class="text-2xl font-meta font-black p-8">
            <h2>Making games</h2>
          </div>
          <p>Armed with my fresh new <span class="text-red"><code>C++</code></span> knowledge and the amazing [LazyFoo’s SDL tutorials]( <span class="text-blue"><a href="https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/">https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/</a></span> ), I was ready to tackle any 2D game that I could think of. What is the game called you ask? [2dGame]( <span class="text-blue"><a href="https://github.com/gbrls/2dGame">https://github.com/gbrls/2dGame</a></span> ) of course, why not? If you know something about <span class="text-red"><code>C++</code></span> , you already know that it didn’t work as I expected. Even though I grasped the language’s syntax and basic abstractions, <em>even though I KNEW pointers</em> there was some giant beast that destroyed me, the <strong><em>RUNTIME</em></strong>.</p>
          <p>There were <em>segmentation faults</em> all around, some predictable, some very unpredictable. The issue was that before my code interacted with a small domain (The <span class="text-red"><code>flash</code></span> engine, A small embedded system with <span class="text-red"><code>Arduino</code></span> helping me, the JVM with Processing helping me) and now it interacted directly with the whole computer system, <em>“real programming”</em>, or in fact, Systems Programming (I wish I knew that back then). Classes and methods didn’t help me if I dont’t understand the stack or the heap.</p>
          <div class="text-2xl font-meta font-black p-8">
            <h2>Having fun with Gophers</h2>
          </div>
          <p>I moved on to other things: Web programming in <span class="text-red"><code>Go</code></span> . When I discovered <span class="text-red"><code>Go</code></span> I felt the same thing that I did when I started coding Processing. It was novel, fun, and powerful. Some things struck me as essential to <span class="text-red"><code>Go</code></span> ‘s joy:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How simple it was.</li>
            <li>Easy parallelism.</li>
            <li><strong></strong>How easy it was to use other peoples’ code together with mine<strong></strong>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Due to those things I was making games easily, and interacting with the web with joy. I learnt a lot of things and had a great time, thanks <span class="text-red"><code>Go</code></span> .</p>
          <p>One of the things was semantic versioning of dependencies. I love immutable things, <span class="text-red"><code>Go</code></span> was creating some sort of global registry for all of those different versions and I got involved in some open source project related to it. It was very little but it still felt nice.</p>
          <div class="text-2xl font-meta font-black p-8">
            <h2>A lot of Systems Programming</h2>
          </div>
          <p>I can’t recall why or how, but I started going back to Systems Programming, I learnt <em>the basics</em> of <span class="text-red"><code>Rust</code></span> and understood why programming <span class="text-red"><code>C++</code></span> was so hard back then. I was making steady progress learning about systems and programming in C. I’d say that was the most formative time for me in terms of how much effort I investest learning about programming and computers in general.</p>
          <p>I don’t know why but I started reading <em>Land of <span class="text-red"><code>Lisp</code></span></em> and it really did fuck me up.</p>
          <div class="text-2xl font-meta font-black p-8">
            <h2>Psychedelic Programming Languages</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="text-2xl font-meta font-black p-8">
            <h2>My first trip</h2>
          </div>
          <p>Common <span class="text-red"><code>Lisp</code></span> is a psychedelic programming language, and <em>Land of <span class="text-red"><code>Lisp</code></span></em> really did show that.</p>
          <p>![image]( <span class="text-blue"><a href="https://www">https://www</a></span> . <span class="text-red"><code>lisp</code></span> erati.com/different.jpg)</p>
          <p>It’s an amazing book and it opened up my mind with <span class="text-red"><code>Lisp</code></span> . It presented itself in a very “Look how amazing, cool, and different <span class="text-red"><code>Lisp</code></span> is!!” it clicked for me. Now the walls seemed to breathe and I love parenthesis man! It also opened up my mind to functional programming, that for a long time seemed to be only reserved to academics obsessed with <em>proofs, purity and elegance(?)</em>.</p>
          <p>This experience changed how I programmed and thought about programming. But I still felt like the same Gabriel that breathed Systems Programming… but this time a lot more confident in my programming skills. I decided to code a minecraft clone from scratch using only <span class="text-red"><code>C++</code></span> , SDL, and OpenGL. This time, I want to show the old Gabriel how good of a programmer I am now, how much I can do. I still had some issues with the runtime, specially related to performance and allocations, but this time I was able to [succeed somewhat]( <span class="text-blue"><a href="https://github.com/gbrls/myncraft">https://github.com/gbrls/myncraft</a></span> ).</p>
          <div class="text-2xl font-meta font-black p-8">
            <h2>My second trip</h2>
          </div>
          <p>My second psychedelic programming experience was not given by a book or something made by nature, but by this fella named [Dan Grossman]( <span class="text-blue"><a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~873260">https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~873260</a></span> ). He has a three part course in Coursera named, you guessed it, <em>Programming Languages</em>. He’s like a Programming Languages god and taught <span class="text-red"><code>ML</code></span> , <span class="text-red"><code>Scheme</code></span> , and <span class="text-red"><code>Ruby</code></span> in an amazing way.</p>
          <p><span class="text-red"><code>ML</code></span> is a psychedelic language. It opened my eyes to what a good type system is capable of. Fuck C’s, <span class="text-red"><code>C++</code></span> ‘s fuck <span class="text-red"><code>Java</code></span> ‘s and fuck <span class="text-red"><code>Java</code></span> . <span class="text-red"><code>ML</code></span> has a <strong></strong>REAL<strong></strong> type system. To me this really shows how powerful this experience was, when after it you are fuck this fuck that I know better, fuck you. And <span class="text-red"><code>ML</code></span> gave me that.</p>
          <p>I guess I could’ve had that same experience from learning Haskell, but I never was able to get into it, I guess it was just too… uptight, too square, too self conscious.</p>
          <p>That course also taught me a lot of vocabulary and mechanisms to compare programming languages fairly. It made me look <span class="text-red"><code>Rust</code></span> with new eyes, like dude, it has <em>Sum Types</em>, <strong></strong>good<strong></strong> <em>Type Inference</em> and all of those goodies. This time I fell in love for <span class="text-red"><code>Rust</code></span> , for real (that’s funny because the course had nothing to do with it).</p>
          <p>I felt blessed by the Programming Languages teaching, I was watching long theoretical Programming Languages youtube videos, reading papers, writing compilers, oh boy. That second trip really got me well, it changed me deeply. Heck I even went to a conference (By luck that was 2020 and many important conferences were being conducted remotely, even for free) and got to ask questions to important people related to Programming Languages history. I was in the same slack channel as Rich Hickey! isn’t it crazy?</p>
          <p>With some time my interests shifted a little from Systems Programming, those languages that by the time were already my old friends like <span class="text-red"><code>C++</code></span> and <span class="text-red"><code>Rust</code></span> became too heavy, I’m not thinking about performance nor memory that much, so why are you getting in the way?</p>
          <div class="text-2xl font-meta font-black p-8">
            <h2>Finding your home</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="text-2xl font-meta font-black p-8">
            <h2>My third trip</h2>
          </div>
          <p>This one wasn’t as crazy as the other ones, it felt like searching and finding for my own home. I came across the book [Data Oriented Programming]( <span class="text-blue"><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/data-oriented-programming">https://www.manning.com/books/data-oriented-programming</a></span> ) by Yehonathan Sharvit, it talked about the style of programming that’s commonly adopted by <span class="text-red"><code>Clojure</code></span> programmers, they tend to focus on the data and transformations to it.</p>
          <p>Things should be simpler, data organized only as plain data. Arrays, maps, tuples. Functions transform data (never mutate it) and worry about the runtime later.</p>
          <p>That’s <span class="text-red"><code>Clojure</code></span> ‘s way (it even has two differents runtimes) and I feel like that’s also the Data Oriented Programming way. <span class="text-red"><code>Elixir</code></span> also fit in this niche pretty nicely. So this time it’s not even a just Programming Language, it’s a mix of a Programming Paradigm, a Language, and a Runtime.</p>
          <p>I even feel somewhat disconnected from that old Systems Programmer Gabriel, we’re not the same person. My head is so tuned to programming this way now. <span class="text-red"><code>Clojure</code></span> is a psychedelic programming language . Of course I still face some problems, but they’re different and better now.</p>
          <div class="text-2xl font-meta font-black p-8">
            <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
          </div>
          <p>That’s what I wanted to say with this blogpost, how some experiences with Programming feel so much <em>Psyschedelic</em>. They change the way you think permanently, that they may feel even religious, they’re powerful.</p>
          <p>Programming Languages, ideas about Programming in general can be crazy, very philosophical, and practical at the same time. I think most of them should be given a chance, they may change you.</p>
          <p>Thanks for reading. Hope you had a good time.</p>
