## Motivations and Philosophy

This website is part of a larger of system of notes and knowledge that I'm
maintaining for myself. What you see here is the small window that I chose to
show to the Internet.


My biggest inspirations are:

- [Andy Matuschak's work](https://andymatuschak.org/)
- [Asimov's _"Prime Radiant"_ device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory_(fictional)#The_Prime_Radiant)
- [Vannevar Bush's essay _"As We May Think"_ ](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)

### Tech

For HTML generation this website uses [zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola).
It's hosted on Github Pages and it uses Github Actions to [fetch files from my
Dropbox](https://github.com/gbrls/action-dropbox-download) and update the
website. All the source code is [hosted
here](https://github.com/gbrls/gbrls.github.io).



[Se here](/blog/current-organizational-structure/) for a historic backgroud of
how my notes system evolved.
