Hi, I'm [Gabriel Schneider](/about). My main interests are in Programming, Hacking, 
Reverse Engineering, CTFs at [ELT](https://ctftime.org/team/9061).



It's really wonderful how we can build a place for ourselves on the
Internet where everybody else can see it.


The Internet has a potential to create a space where we can share ideas in a
descentralized way, follow our interests and access information. **We are the
ones who create value in it, the power is in our hands to make a
change**. 


You can find me on [mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/@gbrls).
