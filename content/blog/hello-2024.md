With about 40% of the year gone I say hello :)


I'm way behind schedule for what I expected to post here this year, so I'm
going to make up for it now. I'm going to try to cover topics in a cartoonish
way like the book "Land of Lisp" by Conrad Barski, one of my favourites in any
topics, it made me completely obsessed with Lisp.

I want to make things which make people be interested and curious about _cool
stuff_  like that book did to me, there could be so much more books like it in
so many different topics.

I'm also teaching myself how to draw better and it's working! I can confidently
draw better and faster, this makes me really excited to put this skill to use
in a new project.

I learned a lot of new things and joined a Security CTF team, so there are
topics which I've never covered before. I have an itch to write about those for
a while now.
