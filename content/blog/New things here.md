# New things here

Hey there, this website has been through some changes recently. Most of them
came from insights that I had from learning Github Actions.
Others came from me applying the _Unix philosophy_ in my note-taking systems.

I finally with integrated my
[PKMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management). This means
that my personal notes can be very easily put here, no need to copy them to
somewhere else, this website will update itself directly from my Dropbox.

I have a [rss feed](https://gbrls.github.io/rss.xml) now.

The CSS was made by someone who understands what they're doing (not me).

I moved away from Hugo to now use Zola.


And that's pretty much it, cheers.
