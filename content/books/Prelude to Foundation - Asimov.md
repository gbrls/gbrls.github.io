This is the second time that I'm writing this because the first text was stored in WSL, and I forgot about it when I was deleting WSL.

What I found most interesting about this book are the allegories that it makes to other generes.

## The book itself
The book is structured like a legend or a myth, it's structured like the Hero's Journey and it quite resembles the Odyssey: Hari Seldon goes through a few different places, tries to understand them better, gets in trouble and then has to run away. I quite like this style of writing because if fits really well with the theme of the book: The myth of creation of psychohistory.

## Mycogeneans
They like in a closed society, following old rules and they worship a distant past in a distant planet and they adore this book that tell them all about this place.
They're basically Orthodox Jews, women even shave their heads!

## Dahl
Dahl is basically any 3rd world country, I can't even call this developing anymore because it seems to me that Brazil is just getting worse. Everybody carries knives even though it's illegal and the police doesn't care, **only when they want to incriminate someone**.
