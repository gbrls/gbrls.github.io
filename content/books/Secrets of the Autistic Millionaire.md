Despite the title being very clickbaity, the book is really genuine.

## His business
He started a software business around a tool (it's not very clear what is does) in the early 2000's and after not very long he was making tens of thousands of dollars a month.
This makes me wonder if making an online business today is harder or easier... Of course it's easier now, but why is it seems to me so hard to start one?
