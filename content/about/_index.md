Hey there I'm Gabriel Schneider.

I have dedicated myself for a long time in compilers, programming languages,
competitive programming, and in low level / embedded development.

I also dabble in multiple forms of Art, I'm a big blender fan, drawing stuff on
paper and digitally (sometimes with code), making some music and making some
videos too.

Feel free to reach me out for feedback, project ideas, (anything really), on
social media or at:

My biggest inspirations for building this blog are:

- [Andy Matuschak's work](https://andymatuschak.org/)
- [Asimov's _"Prime Radiant"_ device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory_(fictional)#The_Prime_Radiant)
- [Vannevar Bush's essay _"As We May Think"_ ](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)




For HTML generation this website uses [zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola).
Depending where you're reading this website is either on Github Pages or
self-hosted by me. I write my blogs on my Dropbox folder in they're sent
automatically here, I wrote a custom script for it.

Most of the source code is [hosted
here](https://github.com/gbrls/gbrls.github.io).

[Se here](/blog/current-organizational-structure.md) for a historic backgroud of
how my notes system evolved.
