Hey there I'm Gabriel Schneider.


I'm a long time computer person, trying to build and destroy stuff, I'm a hacker.

I'm working as a Red Teamer in a ecommerce company.

I have a background in compilers, programming languages, competitive programming, and
in low level / embedded development.

Feel free to reach me out for feedback, project ideas, (anything really), on
social media or at:

My biggest inspirations for building this blog are:

- [Andy Matuschak's work](https://andymatuschak.org/)
- [Asimov's _"Prime Radiant"_ device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory_(fictional)#The_Prime_Radiant)
- [Vannevar Bush's essay _"As We May Think"_ ](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)




For HTML generation this website uses [zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola).
Depending where you're reading this website is either on Github Pages or
self-hosted by me. I write my blogs on my Dropbox folder in they're sent
automatically here, I wrote a custom script for it.

Most of the source code is [hosted
here](https://github.com/gbrls/gbrls.github.io).

[Se here](/blog/current-organizational-structure.md) for a historic backgroud of
how my notes system evolved.
