      <description>Despite the title being very clickbaity, the book is really genuine.&#xA;His business He started a software business around a tool (it&amp;rsquo;s not very clear what is does) in the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s and after not very long he was making tens of thousands of dollars a month. This makes me wonder if making an online business today is harder or easier&amp;hellip; Of course it&amp;rsquo;s easier now, but why is it seems to me so hard to start one?</description>

      <title>The End of Eternity - Isaac Asimov</title>

      <description>I expected this book to no be really connected to other Asimov&amp;rsquo;s novels and in some ways it&amp;rsquo;s by itself a great book, but it&amp;rsquo;s like a cornerstone were many many books are built upon.&#xA;In this book Asimov talks explicitly about some ideas of greatness and the mediocre. Mankind can never evolve the ability of control of it&amp;rsquo;s future because it&amp;rsquo;ll always take the safest and most mediocre path, and this will eventually lead to self destruction (by depression basically).</description>

      <description>This is the second time that I&amp;rsquo;m writing this because the first text was stored in WSL, and I forgot about it when I was deleting WSL.&#xA;What I found most interesting about this book are the allegories that it makes to other generes.&#xA;The book itself The book is structured like a legend or a myth, it&amp;rsquo;s structured like the Hero&amp;rsquo;s Journey and it quite resembles the Odyssey: Hari Seldon goes through a few different places, tries to understand them better, gets in trouble and then has to run away.</description>

      <title>Foundation&#39;s Edge - Isaac Asimov</title>

      <description>Intro This book was released almost thirty years after &amp;ldquo;Second Foundation&amp;rdquo;, which was the latest book in the story&amp;rsquo;s chronology. Many things in the original trilogy that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really happy with or that were a bit &amp;ldquo;outdated&amp;rdquo; are addressed in this book.&#xA;Asimov&amp;rsquo;s brilliance One of the things that I like the most about Asimov&amp;rsquo;s writing is that he&amp;rsquo;s interested in many different things and this knowlege really shows in his books.</description>

      <title>Foundation and Empire - Isaac Asimov</title>

      <description>This is the second book from the foundation&amp;rsquo;s original trilogy. The pacing is way slower compared to the first book, and in some way it executes it nicely, going into more detail about each character and how the events happened. It makes sense too, because this book marks a huge turning point in the story, that happens very quickly, hence the change of pacing.&#xA;That said, I think it loses some of the novelty from the first one and it seldom gave me a deep insight like the first one did.</description>

      <description>This was my first Asimov book and my first Sci-fi book at all. I expected a book about how the future, about how technology will change the way we live, etc. But it was very different, not in a bad way.&#xA;I soon realized that one of the powerful things about Sci-fi is that the author can talk about historical facts in a new light. e.g: Asimov talks about the fall of empires without talking directly about anything that existed (like the Roman Empire), this means that we as the reader can have new views about it, untaited by our previous conceptions.</description>
