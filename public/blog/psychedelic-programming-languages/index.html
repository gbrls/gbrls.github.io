<p>I started programming to make simple webpages and Flash games. To me it was
about interacting with those systems, adding automation to them. Not long after
that I started coding robots with Arduino and it was still just that,
automating turning on a led, reading a value, writing something to a terminal,
etc.</p>
<p>It started to change when I discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain">The Coding
Train</a>, through that I started to
see, actually <em>see</em> how complex and amazing could be the things you did with
code. It was then that I started  to get concerned with abstractions, my code
grew bigger and everything was so messy! I needed some help. Processing is
<em>based</em> on Java which means the tools that I used to handle that complexity
were Functions, Classes and Methods, it was actually fun.</p>
<p>At the same time, I was part of a team making Arduino robots to compete. I
quickly applied the tools that I learnt with Processing to Arduino, afterall
they&rsquo;re similar. I had no notion of state machines and agents, so the code was
a mess and it didn&rsquo;t work well. But, you know, all was good, I felt in control
of the code, still very fun.</p>
<p>During that time I met with some people that blew my mind my showing me how
<em>&ldquo;real programmign&rdquo;</em> was like with C# and machine learning. I felt like I
needed to learn some real programming&hellip; and I wanted to code my own <em>Dwarf
Fortress</em>. I searched online, Dwarf Fortress was made in C++, Arduino was
<em>based</em> on C++ so it shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard, right? Right??  Well, I printed a
C++ book, <em>Jumping into C++</em> and ate it; it taught the basics of pointers,
structs, methods, classes and templates, it&rsquo;s a nice book.</p>
<h2 id="making-games">Making games</h2>
<p>Armed with my fresh new C++ knowledge and the amazing <a href="https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/">LazyFoo&rsquo;s SDL
tutorials</a>, I was ready to tackle any 2D
game that I could think of.
What is the game called you ask? <a href="https://github.com/gbrls/2dGame">2dGame</a> of
course, why not? If you know something about C++, you already know that it
didn&rsquo;t work as I expected. Even though I grasped the language&rsquo;s syntax and
basic abstractions, <em>even though I KNEW pointers</em> there was some giant beast
that destroyed me, the <em><em>RUNTIME</em></em>.</p>
<p>There were <em>segmentation faults</em> all around, some predictable, some very
unpredictable. The issue was that before my code interacted with a small domain
(The flash engine, A small embedded system with Arduino helping me, the JVM
with Processing helping me) and now it interacted directly with the whole
computer system, <em>&ldquo;real programming&rdquo;</em>, or in fact, Systems Programming (I wish
I knew that back then). Classes and methods didn&rsquo;t help me if I dont&rsquo;t
understand the stack or the heap.</p>
<h2 id="having-fun-with-gophers">Having fun with Gophers</h2>
<p>I moved on to other things: Web programming in Go. When I discovered Go I felt
the same thing that I did when I started coding Processing. It was novel, fun,
and powerful. Some things struck me as essential to Go&rsquo;s joy:</p>
<ul>
<li>How simple it was.</li>
<li>Easy parallelism.</li>
<li><strong>How easy it was to use other peoples&rsquo; code together with mine</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to those things I was making games easily, and interacting with the web
with joy. I learnt a lot of things and had a great time, thanks Go.</p>
<p>One of the things was semantic versioning of dependencies. I love immutable
things, Go was creating some sort of global registry for all of those different
versions and I got involved in some open source project related to it. It was
very little but it still felt nice.</p>
<h2 id="a-lot-of-systems-programming">A lot of Systems Programming</h2>
<p>I can&rsquo;t recall why or how, but I started going back to Systems Programming, I
learnt <em>the basics</em> of Rust and understood why programming C++ was so hard back
then.
I was making steady progress learning about systems and programming in C. I&rsquo;d
say that was the most formative time for me in terms of how much effort I
investest learning about programming and computers in general.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why but I started reading <em>Land of Lisp</em> and it really did fuck me up.</p>
<h1 id="psychedelic-programming-languages">Psychedelic Programming Languages</h1>
<h2 id="my-first-trip">My first trip</h2>
<p>Common Lisp is a psychedelic programming language, and <em>Land of Lisp</em> really
did show that.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.lisperati.com/different.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an
amazing book and it opened up my mind with Lisp. It presented itself in a very
&ldquo;Look how amazing, cool, and different Lisp is!!&rdquo; it clicked for me. Now the
walls seemed to breathe and I love parenthesis man! It also opened up my mind
to functional programming, that for a long time seemed to be only
reserved to academics obsessed with <em>proofs, purity and elegance(?)</em>.</p>
<p>This experience changed how I programmed and thought about programming. But I
still felt like the same Gabriel that breathed Systems Programming&hellip; but this
time a lot more confident in my programming skills. I decided to code a
minecraft clone from scratch using only C++, SDL, and OpenGL. This time, I want
to show the old Gabriel how good of a programmer I am now, how much I can do. I
still had some issues with the runtime, specially related to performance and
allocations, but this time I was able to <a href="https://github.com/gbrls/myncraft">succeed
somewhat</a>.</p>
<h2 id="my-second-trip">My second trip</h2>
<p>My second psychedelic programming experience was not given by a book or
something made by nature, but by this fella named <a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~873260">Dan
Grossman</a>. He has a three part
course in Coursera named, you guessed it, <em>Programming Languages</em>. He&rsquo;s like
a Programming Languages god and taught ML, Scheme, and Ruby in an amazing way.</p>
<p>ML is a psychedelic language. It opened my eyes to what a good type system is
capable of. Fuck C&rsquo;s,  C++&rsquo;s fuck Java&rsquo;s and fuck Java. ML has a <strong>REAL</strong> type
system. To me this really shows how powerful this experience was, when after it
you are fuck this fuck that I know better, fuck you. And ML gave me that.</p>
<p>I guess I could&rsquo;ve had that same experience from learning Haskell, but I never
was able to get into it, I guess it was just too&hellip; uptight, too square, too
self conscious.</p>
<p>That course also taught me a lot of vocabulary and mechanisms to compare
programming languages fairly. It made me look Rust with new eyes, like dude, it
has <em>Sum Types</em>, <strong>good</strong> <em>Type Inference</em> and all of those goodies. This time
I fell in love for Rust, for real (that&rsquo;s funny because the course had nothing
to do with it).</p>
<p>I felt blessed by the Programming Languages teaching, I was watching long
theoretical Programming Languages youtube videos, reading papers, writing
compilers, oh boy. That second trip really got me well, it changed me deeply.
Heck I even went to a conference (By luck that was 2020 and many important
conferences were being conducted remotely, even for free) and got to ask
questions to important people related to Programming Languages history. I was
in the same slack channel as Rich Hickey! isn&rsquo;t it crazy?</p>
<p>With some time my interests shifted a little from Systems Programming, those
languages that by the time were already my old friends like C++ and Rust became
too heavy, I&rsquo;m not thinking about performance nor memory that much, so why are
you getting in the way?</p>
<h1 id="finding-your-home">Finding your home</h1>
<h2 id="my-third-trip">My third trip</h2>
<p>This one wasn&rsquo;t as crazy as the other ones, it felt like searching and finding
for my own home. I came across the book <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/data-oriented-programming">Data Oriented
Programming</a> by
Yehonathan Sharvit, it talked about the style of programming that&rsquo;s commonly
adopted by Clojure programmers, they tend to focus on the data and
transformations to it.</p>
<pre><code>Things should be simpler, data organized only as plain data. Arrays, maps,
tuples. Functions transform data (never mutate it) and worry about the
runtime later.
</code></pre>
<p>That&rsquo;s Clojure&rsquo;s way (it even has two differents runtimes) and I feel like
that&rsquo;s also the Data Oriented Programming way. Elixir also fit in this niche
pretty nicely. So this time it&rsquo;s not even a just Programming Language, it&rsquo;s a
mix of a Programming Paradigm, a Language, and a Runtime.</p>
<p>I even feel somewhat disconnected from that old Systems Programmer Gabriel,
we&rsquo;re not the same person. My head is so tuned to programming this way now.
Clojure is a psychedelic programming language . Of course I still face some
problems, but they&rsquo;re different and better now.</p>
<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h1>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I wanted to say with this blogpost, how some experiences with
Programming feel so much <em>Psyschedelic</em>. They change the way
you think permanently, that they may feel even religious, they&rsquo;re powerful.</p>
<p>Programming Languages, ideas about Programming in general can be crazy, very
philosophical, and practical at the same time. I think most of them should be
given a chance, they may change you.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. Hope you had a good time.</p>
