    <h1>myLisp Interpreter 0: What is Lisp?</h1>

    <p>This is the first part of a series of articles that I&rsquo;ll be writing to document
my progress on building a interpreter for a Lisp-like language.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been interested in learning different programming languages for a while now, I&rsquo;ve read the
first chapters of Haskell and Lisp books recently and the one that hooked me on was <a href="http://landoflisp.com/">Land
of lisp</a>. Lisp&rsquo;s simplicity really struck me: from very
simple building blocks you can create anything in such an elegant and simple way.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-mylisp">What is myLisp</h3>
<p>myLisp is a lisp-like language, the main goal of it is to be implemented in
the most simple and educational way possible.<br>
So, what is lisp?</p>
<h3 id="a-bit-of-history">A bit of history</h3>
<p>Lisp is a programming language that was invented in the late 50&rsquo;s by John McCarthy, in 1960 he published a
<a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.html">paper</a> where he defined the
language and wrote a Lisp interpreter in Lisp! It&rsquo;s crazy to think that you can
write a interpreter for Lisp in Lisp in such an small and beautiful way using only simple
operations, it really shows its elegance and power. There&rsquo;s a more <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html">approachable
paper</a> by Paul Graham in which he
explains step by step how Lisp was defined in McCarthy&rsquo;s paper, here&rsquo;s an
excerpt from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<em>I wrote this article to help myself understand exactly what McCarthy
discovered. You don&rsquo;t need to know this stuff to program in Lisp, but it
should be helpful to anyone who wants to understand the essence of Lisp - both
in the sense of its origins and its semantic core. The fact that it has such a
core is one of Lisp&rsquo;s distinguishing features (&hellip;)</em>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h3>
<p>The building blocks of Lisp are cons cells. It is a structure that holds two
values, head and tail or as Lisp calls them: <code>CAR</code> and <code>CDR</code>. Each of them can
either point to another cons cell or to atoms. Atoms are anything that can&rsquo;t be
divided into smaller parts (as we can with cons cells which can be divided into
two parts) such as: <code>14</code>, <code>hello-there</code>,
<code>aux</code>, <code>&quot;I'm a string&quot;</code>.
Bellow you can see some examples on how cons cells can work together:</p>

<p><em>Example 1: List</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Example 2: Nested list</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>NIL is a special object which denotes the end of a list. As you can see from the first example we&rsquo;ve just created a list, which is the
single most important data structure in Lisp. That&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s name comes from:
<strong>LIS</strong>t <strong>P</strong>rocessor.</p>
<h3 id="s-expressions">S-Expressions</h3>
<p>Now that we know the basic concepts of the language we are going to learn how to
represent them in Lisp code.</p>
<p>S-Expressions are how Lisp represent its code and data. Code and data being
represented in the same way is a very important concept to Lisp, it is called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity">homoiconicity</a>. They can be in the form of atoms or other s-expressions enclosed by
parenthesis and separated by a whitespace.</p>
<p>Lets see how the examples 1 and 2 can be represented using S-Expressions.</p>
<pre><code>(42 69 613)
(c-major (c e g))
</code></pre>
<p>Lisp can look at these two expressions as code or as data. By default Lisp reads
them as if they were code. The first element of an expression, (it&rsquo;s <code>CAR</code>)
is interpreted as a function, so <code>(f a b)</code> has the same meaning as <code>f(a, b);</code>
have in C, for example.</p>
<h3 id="basic-functions">Basic functions</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>PRINT</code>: Receives an expression as its input, prints it, and then returns it.</li>
<li><code>QUOTE</code>: Receives an expression as its input and returns it, without evaluating
it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try these two functions, let&rsquo;s say that I want to print the list from the
first example. If I call <code>(PRINT (32 69 613))</code> it will throw an error because
Lisp will try to call the function <code>32</code> with <code>69</code> and <code>613</code> as its arguments.
But if I call <code>(PRINT (QUOTE (32 69 613)))</code> it will work as I intended,
because <code>QUOTE</code> returns <code>(32 69 613)</code> and then <code>PRINT</code> prints it, so <code>QUOTE</code> is
a way to convert code into data.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CONS</code>: Takes <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and returns a cons cell with <code>a</code> as it&rsquo;s first part and
<code>b</code> as the second.</li>
<li><code>CAR</code>: Takes a cons cell and returns it&rsquo;s first part.</li>
<li><code>CDR</code>: Takes a cons cell and returns it&rsquo;s second part.</li>
<li><code>CADR</code>: Same as <code>CAR(CDR(a))</code>, <code>CDDR</code>: Same as <code>(CDR(CDR(a)))</code>, <code>CADDR</code>,
<code>CADAR</code>, &hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(CONS (QUOTE A) (CONS (QUOTE B) NIL))</code> returns <code>(A B)</code>.</li>
<li>Expression to create the nested list from the second image:<br>
<code>(CONS (QUOTE C-MAJOR) (CONS (CONS (QUOTE C) (CONS (QUOTE E) (CONS (QUOTE G) NIL))) NIL))</code> which returns <code>(C-MAJOR (C E G))</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sidenote: You don&rsquo;t have to declare things this way, I just made this way for
illustration purposes, in Lisp you could also just do</em> <code>(QUOTE (C-MAJOR (C E G)))</code>.</p>
<p>There are other important functions that we&rsquo;ll be discussing later, but for the
next article they are enough.</p>
