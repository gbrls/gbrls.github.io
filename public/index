Welcome to my Blog :), here I talk about Hacking, Programming, and Random stuff.


This website is hosted by me, and it's programmed by me. I think it's really
wonderful how we can build a place for ourselves on the Internet where
everybody else can see it.

Unfortunately the Web is not the Internet. It has enabled the centralization of
content in a handful of platforms and the monetization of our browsing.

I believe the Internet has a much bigger potential to create a space where we
can share ideas in a descentralized way, follow our interests and access
information.

I don't have a silver bullet to solve those things, but I can see how things
can get better. We are the ones who create value to those platforms, the power
is in our hands to make a change.


For now, this website is hosted on the Web, and until something better comes
by, I see you there.
