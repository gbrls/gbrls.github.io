      <description>This is the harder version of donations, it&amp;rsquo;s the same challenge, but you can&amp;rsquo;t donate negative amounts this time.&#xA;After playing with it for a while, I realized that the solution was probably to find a way to donate money to your user, bypassing that Jeff Bezos check. So I tested adding more user id&amp;rsquo;s in the to parameter and the money went to them.&#xA;So the solution was to create users, and donate all of their money to a user which will retrieve the flag.</description>

      <description>After downloading and prettifying the javascript code we see that there&amp;rsquo;s a /api/flag and a /api/donate endpoints.&#xA;The flag route returns:&#xA;{&amp;#34;detail&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;only the wealthy may view the treasure...&amp;#34;} After trying some things that didn&amp;rsquo;t work, I went to the donate functionality. Using the parameters that I found in the javascript I is playing with this funcionality and noticed that you can only donate to a specific user&#xA;{&amp;#34;detail&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;you may only donate to Jeff Bezos&amp;#34;} And somehow that Jeff Bezos&amp;rsquo;s id is lisanalgaib</description>

      <description>Burp collaborator is the thing that I miss the most in the free community version, and after that is the search. The Burp Collaborator is a tool that generates a domain and any interaction with that domain via DNS, HTTP and SMTP (maybe others are available too).&#xA;Anyways, Burp Collaborator is really useful, but it&amp;rsquo;s paid (I can&amp;rsquo;t recommend it to everyone because of that) and it&amp;rsquo;s made to work inside Burp Suite, which comes with a whole set of limitations.</description>

      <description>Last weekend I got this email:&#xA;Dear Gabriel, We are happy to inform you that you have successfully completed the Advanced Web Attacks and Exploitation certification exam and have obtained your Offsec Web Expert (OSWE) certification.&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s something weird about opening those emails which contain the result of something that I really wanted. Result in Rust&amp;rsquo;s semantics, a Sum type, which before opening it, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it worked or not.</description>
