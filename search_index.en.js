This one I was using to test digital systems.\n\n\n\nSo, were does this come from? Is this generated by some slow recursive algorithm? No! This complete binary tree is generated by this code:\n    if (col &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; line)) != 0 {\n        *pixel = c[line % c.len()];\n    }\n\nHow it works\nSo, how does this work? Well, let's count binary numbers.\n    111\n    110\n    101\n    100\n\n    011\n    010\n    001\n    000\n\nThe leftmost bit changes every four lines, the middle bit every two lines and the rightmost every other line. From this pattern it's clear that every combination of the three bits will be generated once, for this reason and because it's very easy to generate I was using it to test my digital circuit.\nBut how do we generate these numbers? Just count from 0 up to 2^n - 1, in this case from 0 to 7:\n    000 = 0\n    001 = 1\n    010 = 2\n    011 = 3\n    100 = 4\n    101 = 5\n    110 = 6\n    111 = 7\n\nThe tree\nThis is also a complete binary tree. If you think about it as a decision tree, it may be easier to see the reason why. The first bit can be either true of false, for each case the second bit can be true or false too; if one is true, it is highlighted, otherwise it's black. The number of different leaves is exactly the number of all possible binary strings with H bits, where H is equal to the height of the tree.\n","id":"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/binbin-tree/","title":"Binary Binary Tree"},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/c-gems-homoiconicity-in-c/":{"body":"C Wizardry intro\nSometimes I find some neat, crazy, cryptic features of the C programming\nlanguage.  As a Teaching Assistant for it, I believe I must become a C\nwizard and scare the students with some esoteric magical spells. So, this is\ngoing to be a series of posts about weird (and maybe useful) stuff in C.\nHomoiconicity\nIt's a word known by Lisp users and Programming Language nerds. It's a\nreally important feature of Lisp (I talked a bit about it in my Make a Lisp\nInterpreter series). The basic idea is that you can use code as data and data as code,\ne.g: In languages where you have an eval function, you can read a string and then\neval it, doing this you're using data as code, one way to use code as data are\nmacros, they manipulate code in compile time as data, though when talking about\nhomoiconicity it also means to manipulate code as data in the runtime.\nHomoiconicity in C\nThis week I was studying JIT\nCompilers and came\nacross this\npost,\n\nThe article shows this code, that demonstrates how to execute memory in C,\n(disclaimer: This only works on Unix systems).\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n  // Machine code for:\n  //   mov eax, 0\n  //   ret\n  unsigned char code[] = {0xb8, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xc3};\n\n  if (argc &lt; 2) {\n    fprintf(stderr, \"Usage: jit1 &lt;integer&gt;\\n\");\n    return 1;\n  }\n\n  // Overwrite immediate value \"0\" in the instruction\n  // with the user's value.  This will make our code:\n  //   mov eax, &lt;user's value&gt;\n  //   ret\n  int num = atoi(argv[1]);\n  memcpy(&amp;code[1], &amp;num, 4);\n\n  // Allocate writable/executable memory.\n  // Note: real programs should not map memory both writable\n  // and executable because it is a security risk.\n  void *mem = mmap(NULL, sizeof(code), PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC,\n                   MAP_ANON | MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0);\n  memcpy(mem, code, sizeof(code));\n\n  // The function will return the user's value.\n  int (*func)() = mem;\n  return func();\n}\n\nI encourage you to run this code to get a feeling of it, but what it means is\nthat you can create an array, manipulate it as a regular array and then\nexecute it as code!\nNow, the other way around (manipulate code as data) it's also possible.\nWith the help of this stack overflow thread,\nI was able to get it working. The first thing that I did was to try to read a function's bytes:\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\nint f0() {\n    return 42;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int padding[100];\n    memset(padding, -1, sizeof(padding));\n\n    char* p = f0;\n\n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 16; i++) {\n        printf(\"%x \", (int)(p[i] &amp; 0xff));\n    }\n\n    putchar('\\n');\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nAnd this is the output (on my my machine running 20.04 Ubuntu with gcc), I\nhighlighted the actual function code:\n                       v--------------v\nf3 f 1e fa 55 48 89 e5 b8 2a 0 0 0 5d c3 f3\n\nHmmmm, I was expecting gcc to optimize the function definition and discard the\nfunction's boilerplate\ncode,\nwhich is those bytes at the beginning and the 5d before the c3, go figure.\nSo, now that we know that the 42 is in the 10th position in the binary code\n(2a, 16 * 2 + 10 = 42) then we can change it in our code.\nDisclaimer: This code also only runs on Unix systems due to the way that we\nallow the text segment to be writable.\nYou also have to compile with these flags.\ngcc --static -g -Wl,--omagic -o test test.c\n\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\nint f0() {\n    return 42;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int padding[100];\n    memset(padding, -1, sizeof(padding));\n\n    int a = f0();\n\n    char* p = f0;\n    // changing the return value of the function\n    p[9] = 16;\n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 16; i++) {\n        printf(\"%x \", (int)(p[i] &amp; 0xff));\n    }\n    putchar('\\n');\n\n    int b = f0();\n\n    printf(\"a = %d, b = %d\\n\", a, b);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nAnd the output is:\nf3 f 1e fa 55 48 89 e5 b8 10 0 0 0 5d c3 f3\na = 42, b = 16\n\nYay! Now we've used code as data completing the homoiconicity cycle.\nI hope after reading this your view of the C programming language has changed,\nat least a bit. \nWait but C is NOT homoiconic!\nAfter I discovered these two features I was almost sure that C was homoiconic,\nbut I had to do some research to publish this and then I realized why it is\nnot.\n\ndata as code and code as data\n\nThis definition of homoiconicity is not very accurate, here I present a better one:\n\nIn a homoiconic language, the primary representation of programs is also a\ndata structure in a primitive type of the language itself [...]\n\nBelieve it or not this is actually from Wikipedia. So, why doesn't C fit in\nthis definition?  This is because the arrays that we read, wrote and executed\nwere not C code, they were machine code.\nLet's create a simple abstraction, imagine there's a simple homoiconic language.\nHere we're declaring an expression, note that expr holds the expression 1 + 2 * 3 and not 7.\nlet expr = BuildExpr (1 + 2 * 3)\n\nAnd to execute it we would have to do this:\nexpr.compile()\nvm.run(expr.compiled_code) // returns 7\n\nBecause this language is homoiconic we could do things like this:\nget_literals(expr.ast)  // returns [1, 2, 3]\nget_operators(expr.ast) // returns [+, *]\nBuildString (expr.ast)  // \"(+ 1 (* 2 3))\"\n\nNote that we can manipulate the expression in a high-level representation of\nthe language itself. The operations that we're doing in C would look like\nthis:\nexpr.complile()\nexpr.compiled_code[9] = 0x10\nvm.run(expr.compiled_code)\n\nsome_code = [0xb8, 0x99, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xc3]\nvm.run(some_code)\n\nAs you can see this is not the same kind of abstration that we have with this\nhypothetical homoiconic language. In C we can manipulate the compiled code in a\n\"high-level\" representation (if you consider arrays high level) but it's not\nthe C code that we're manipulating, it's just the machine code.\nThis is why C is not homoiconic\nAppendix: Two Homoiconic languages\nI talked about how homoiconicity works and why C is not homoiconic so I thought\nthis article was missing some examples of it.\nMachine code\nTODO\nLisp\nTODO\n","id":"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/c-gems-homoiconicity-in-c/","title":"C Wizardry - Homoiconicity in C"},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/current-organizational-structure/":{"body":"\nMetadata:\n\nOrganization\n\n\n\nPre-history\nMy first concious effort to store data online was through Google Drive, Google\nKeep and Evernote, most are those are lost and are garbage.\n2019 - Vim / Emacs\nIn this period I was using vimwiki and org-mode to write some notes and they're\nhere.

Earlier I've written\nabout getting into\nCybersecurity,\nI was about a month into my internship and it was much more about my reaction\nto: \"You're going to Security now, good luck young one\".\nNow I'm five months in, and many things have changed. I'm still here (literally\nhere, I work from home), I'm still an intern, but still, things are very\ndifferent.\nSo, I'm writing this here because there were many times where I had to stop,\ngrab a piece of paper and just dump the new things that were clouding my head.\nI still wrote almost daily markdown notes on the new things  that I was\nlearning, but still, it's different, sometimes all I need is a blank piece of\npaper and a nice pen. The same way I write a lot to myself, it's not enough,\nfrom time to time I feel the need to share what I've learned, so this is it.\nProcesses &amp; Techniques\nIn the start I was: \"I want to get really good at hacking, so I'm going to\nlearn new techniques and get really good at them, SQL Injection, XSS, wait for\nme I'm coming after you!\". And while there's value to that, by itself,\npracticing those techniques wasn't really going to help me that much. I was\ntrying to turn into a good fighter just by repeatedly punching a punch bag,\nit's not going to work just by itself, I'm going to get my ass kicked this way.\nThe thing that was missing in my approach was actually deeper than I expected,\nto be a hacker you have to think like one. For a very long time my mind was set\non building things and solving problems, I wanted to make robots, games, and\nexplore maths; that was basically it. Software Engineering was a straight path\nahead, it's different, but at the end it's just building things and solving\nproblems. That's not the case with Hacking, at all.\nTo think like a hacker honestly is like listening to your inner devil. When you\ncome across something, you want to take advantage of it, I want to learn about\nit until you know enough to break it. It took a while, but I can feel the\neffects of my self corruption, this inner evil voice is already talking all\nthe fucking time in my head. \nOn the Internet you see hackers doing stuff with Software and then doing\ncrazier stuff with Hardware, it didn't made much sense to me how those people\ncould change domains like that, now it does. It's like coding in Clojure and\nthen going to embedded C, the mindset is basically the same, it's the\nenviroment and the tools for it that changed.\nMy first Big Project\nWhen I started to notice a big improvement in my Dark Arts fighting\ntechniques was when I stopped to think about my thought process and it write\ndown. A month ago I was faced with: \"You have 4-5 weeks to test those websites\nand write a report, good luck pal\". I work in a great team, but I felt like\nthey had put way too much faith in me at the time. For the first week I was\njust testing with the techniques that I had learned, I was much better at those\nthan I was before, but still.\nI had one good finding and that was it. I had a motivation rush after finding\nit, but soon it started to feel like I was trying to climb a huge wall with my\nbare hands. It as then that I stopped, grabbed a piece of paper, a nice pen,\ndid some research about the pentesting process, read some checklists and\nstarted building my own. The thought process was forming in my head from\nworking with my peers, from the things that I was learning from the internet,\nmy head was getting cloudy with it. Writing it down was like making those\nclouds rain, condensating them to water and clearing up my mind.\nThe project is done now and it was a great success. This kind of \"process\norganization\" was very important to it's success.\n\nThings I've learned\nSo, Gabriel, you say; what do you have to show to us? You climbed that wall,\nwrote some shit in some stone slabs, now share it with us!\nSo... I say; beware of the golden calfs out there in Security, there are many!\nThe first things that I liked is that it feels like war. There are clearly\ntwo sides: We (usually a small team or single person) vs them (A company or a\nspecific product). Some of the processes we use for hacking are actually used\nby military intelligence. Lo and behold these are my commandments:\n\nThe fist commandment is: Information is Key.\nLet's say there's a Pizza shop which has their own delivery service. They hired\nus to test its security. The first thing is that we need to do is to gather\ninformation about it. \n\nHow does it work?\nWhich features does it have?\nCan I order Pizza to my neighbour?\nDo they check if I'm the person I'm claiming to be?\n\nAnd then you discover: Oh, if the delivery takes more than 30 minutes the pizza\nis free. What happens if I order pizza from somewhere far away? Will  they\ndeliever to me? What if it's not that far away, but I keep making changes to\nthe order so it takes longer?\nYou can also find hidden things this way, i.e. They have lower prices if it's\nyour birthday, but they only change the price if you ask for it, they keep this\npromotion hidden for some reason. Can I fake my ID to always get lower prices?\n\nYou need to understand how it's supposed to work, its features and\nfunctionalities. So you know what to break and exploit.\n\n\nThe second commandment is: Organization is Key\nWe'll gather a lot of information, it will be needed for writing a report to\nour Pizza shop client, to our attacks, and to share it with our team.\nAlso, for every domain that we are working there will be lots and lots of\ninformation about the specific tools and processes for it. Better organization\nmeans more efficient tests, the next time you do them, because information is\naccessible and searchable. My setup is described\nhere.\nOrganization is also important to keep track of the tests you've done, the time\nyou did them, and which tests are still left to do.\n\nThe third commandment is: Know your domain\nPizza Delivery Services is a very specific domain. Knowing well your domain\nwill greatly improve your chances of success in an attack. Think how having\nworked on the phone in a Pizza Delivery Service would help you exploit another\nPizza delivery companies.\n\nThe forth commandment is: Attack fast and with precision\nMany times you'll need to execute an attack as a proof of concept. The attack\nshould be well planned, precise and fast.\nMost of the time you'll need to take care to not cause disruption to the\nregular services. \nYou'll need to be fast to not give enough time for them to\nreact to it.\nYou'll need to be very careful with PII.\n\nConclusion\nThose commandments are maturing, I'm still very new at this and different\npeople have different styles. Despite those things, I hope they are helpful.\nSecurity is very big and exciting. Have fun and take care.\nReferences\n\nThe Web Application Hacker's Handbook\n\n","id":"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/getting-hands-dirty-with-hacking/","title":"Getting Hands Dirty with Hacking"},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/hello-world/":{"body":"// This is a comment, and is ignored by the compiler\n\n// This is the main function\nfn main() {\n    // Statements here are executed when the compiled binary is called\n\n    // Print text to the console\n    println!(\"Hello World!\");\n}\n\nprintln! is a macro that prints text to the console.\nA binary can be generated using the Rust compiler: rustc.\n$ rustc hello.rs\n\nrustc will produce a hello binary that can be executed.\n$ ./hello\nHello World!\n\n","id":"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/hello-world/","title":"Hello World"},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/making-and-writing-games/":{"body":"Making and Writing Games\nBackground\nMaking games has been big part of my motivation to code since the start. One of\nthe first things that I did was to write games in ActionScript 2 in Flash, they\nweren't good and I didn't even publish them, but it was an important stepping\nstone for me.\nI love writing and programming, so the project to make a story driven game\nhas been for a long time in the back of my head. They're are also easier to\nmake as a single person or small team.\nThe Game's Story\nThe game's story is going to take place in Recife, the city where I was born\nand currently live. It's going to be about doing errands around the city,\nmeeting weird and interesting characters, going to old abandoned places, etc.\nIt's going to be a way to distill and present expeciences that I've had here,\nother people's expeciences, a tribute to Recife in game form.\n\nIt may or may not be linear.\nIt's going to political, it won't be a direct representation of reality\nthough.\nI'll try to make it quirky and funny.\nIt's going to be full of different characters and different places.\nIt's going to take place in a odd reality, maybe a bit scifi / cyberpunk.\n\nThe Game's Gameplay\nUhhh... So... I don't know. It's going to be made in a pixel art style\n(probably), maybe 2d or 3d.\nThe Problem\nSo, I have this ideia of the game laid out, so I just have to start working on\nit, right? The problem is that I did try to do just that, a few times, but\neverytime that I plan to start the game my engineering brain just starts\nscreaming and I waste a few weeks just writing code that'll never end up in the\ngame.\nI start trying to make the basic systems of the game and some basic graphics so\nI can start working on the story, but it doesn't make sense. I don't know how\nthe gameplay'll be, I just want it to be simple, so the story is the game's\nmain element. This difference between wanting to write the story and going at\nfull speed to write the game's code breaks my motivation after a while and I\njust stop and forget about it for a few months.\nProposed Solution\nRecently programming in Clojure and Elixir changed how I think about some things (more info here.\nI'm giving more importance to data and the separation between data and\nbehaviour because of those languages, and I can apply this to this game\nproject.\nYes it's a big project, but the most important thing is the story and the art,\nand that's just data. I can start making those already, writing simple\n(probably disposable) systems to test them and later I'll figure out how those\nthings will get into the game.\nFor now I think I'll make those assets in Clojure, it makes very easy to change\nbetween code and data, serialization happens for free. It's almost like JSON\nfiles that are alive.\n","id":"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/making-and-writing-games/","title":"Making and Writing Games"},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/mk-lisp-0/":{"body":"This is the first part of a series of articles that I'll be writing to document\nmy progress on building a interpreter for a Lisp-like language.\nI've been interested in learning different programming languages for a while now, I've read the\nfirst chapters of Haskell and Lisp books recently and the one that hooked me on was Land\nof lisp. Lisp's simplicity really struck me: from very\nsimple building blocks you can create anything in such an elegant and simple way.\nWhat is myLisp\nmyLisp is a lisp-like language, the main goal of it is to be implemented in \nthe most simple and educational way possible.\nSo, what is lisp?\nA bit of history\nLisp is a programming language that was invented in the late 50's by John McCarthy, in 1960 he published a\npaper where he defined the\nlanguage and wrote a Lisp interpreter in Lisp! It's crazy to think that you can\nwrite a interpreter for Lisp in Lisp in such an small and beautiful way using only simple\noperations, it really shows its elegance and power. There's a more approachable\npaper by Paul Graham in which he\nexplains step by step how Lisp was defined in McCarthy's paper, here's an\nexcerpt from it:\n\n\"I wrote this article to help myself understand exactly what McCarthy\ndiscovered. You don't need to know this stuff to program in Lisp, but it\nshould be helpful to anyone who wants to understand the essence of Lisp - both\nin the sense of its origins and its semantic core. The fact that it has such a\ncore is one of Lisp's distinguishing features (...)\"\n\nWhat is it?\nThe building blocks of Lisp are cons cells. It is a structure that holds two\nvalues, head and tail or as Lisp calls them: CAR and CDR. Each of them can\neither point to another cons cell or to atoms. Atoms are anything that can't be\ndivided into smaller parts (as we can with cons cells which can be divided into\ntwo parts) such as: 14, hello-there,\naux, \"I'm a string\".\nBellow you can see some examples on how cons cells can work together:\n\n\n\n\nExample 1: List\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: Nested list\n\nNIL is a special object which denotes the end of a list. As you can see from the first example we've just created a list, which is the\nsingle most important data structure in Lisp. That's where it's name comes from:\nLISt Processor.\nS-Expressions\nNow that we know the basic concepts of the language we are going to learn how to\nrepresent them in Lisp code.\nS-Expressions are how Lisp represent its code and data. Code and data being\nrepresented in the same way is a very important concept to Lisp, it is called\nhomoiconicity. They can be in the form of atoms or other s-expressions enclosed by\nparenthesis and separated by a whitespace.\nLets see how the examples 1 and 2 can be represented using S-Expressions.\n(42 69 613)\n(c-major (c e g))\n\nLisp can look at these two expressions as code or as data. By default Lisp reads\nthem as if they were code. The first element of an expression, (it's CAR)\nis interpreted as a function, so (f a b) has the same meaning as f(a, b);\nhave in C, for example.\nBasic functions\n\nPRINT: Receives an expression as its input, prints it, and then returns it.\nQUOTE: Receives an expression as its input and returns it, without evaluating\nit.\n\nLet's try these two functions, let's say that I want to print the list from the\nfirst example. If I call (PRINT (32 69 613)) it will throw an error because\nLisp will try to call the function 32 with 69 and 613 as its arguments.\nBut if I call (PRINT (QUOTE (32 69 613))) it will work as I intended,\nbecause QUOTE returns (32 69 613) and then PRINT prints it, so QUOTE is\na way to convert code into data.\n\nCONS: Takes a and b and returns a cons cell with a as it's first part and\nb as the second.\nCAR: Takes a cons cell and returns it's first part.\nCDR: Takes a cons cell and returns it's second part.\nCADR: Same as CAR(CDR(a)), CDDR: Same as (CDR(CDR(a))), CADDR,\nCADAR, ...\n\nExamples: \n\n(CONS (QUOTE A) (CONS (QUOTE B) NIL)) returns (A B).\nExpression to create the nested list from the second image:\n(CONS (QUOTE C-MAJOR) (CONS (CONS (QUOTE C) (CONS (QUOTE E) (CONS (QUOTE G) NIL))) NIL)) which returns (C-MAJOR (C E G)). \n\nSidenote: You don't have to declare things this way, I just made this way for\nillustration purposes, in Lisp you could also just do (QUOTE (C-MAJOR (C E G))).\nThere are other important functions that we'll be discussing later, but for the\nnext article they are enough.\n","id":"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/mk-lisp-0/","title":"myLisp Interpreter 0: What is Lisp?"},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/mk-lisp-1/":{"body":"This is the second part of a series of articles that I'm writing to document by\nprogress on building a Interpreter for myLisp, a lisp-like language. For the previous post click\nhere.\n\nWhat is an interpreter?\nAn Interpreter is a program that takes souce code as input and executes it. It\nis composed of several parts, today we are going to write a lexer and a parser.\nThe lexer will read a string of characters and output a vector of tokens, with\nsome information attached to them like its type. The lexer is important to the\nparser because it returns the soure code in a better representation, holding\nonly information that matters to it, (this is a very important pattern in\nprogramming, thowing away information that is not important for what we want, by\nkeeping the data in a more convenient representation).\nThe parser will take the vector of tokens created by the lexer and create a data\nstructure (in our case S-Expressions) which can then be executed by another part of the interpreter.\nThe interpreter's implementation\nI will be writing this interpreter in C. The most important reason for it is that\nthis is a learning project more than anything else, and in C provides us with\nthe bare minimum to create what we want.\nIt is important to note that there are better ways to implement it, but I don't\nlike to read other people's code before I try my own way. Maybe in the future when I'm done,\nI'll change it.\nLexer\nFirst, lets define a little macro to help us debug.\n#ifdef DEBUG_F\n\n#define DEBUG(fmt, args...)\t\t\t\t\t\t\\\n    printf(\"(%s:%d) \" fmt, __FILE__,__LINE__, ##args)\n\n#else\n\n#define DEBUG(f, fmt, args...) /* Do nothing */\n\n#endif\n\n\nNext, we need to create a few data types to store the tokens.\nAs you can see our Lisp won't support strings and floats for now.\nenum Token_Type {\n    TOKEN_OPEN=0,\n    TOKEN_CLOSE=1,\n    TOKEN_NUMBER=2,\n    TOKEN_SYMBOL=3,\n};\n\n/*\n** Used to debug the lexer\n*/\nchar* Token_Type_Str[4] = {\"(\", \")\", \"NUM\", \"SYM\"};\n\ntypedef struct {\n\tenum Token_Type type;\n\n\tunion {\n\t\tint number;\n\t\tchar* name;\n\t}data;\n\n}Token;\n\nAnd then the tokenize fuction, there are a few details about it that need to be discussed.\nUsually in Lisp, symbol names can be in some written in some formats, like +1, +$,\n10@b.com. But for simplicity's sake we have a different set of rules: They must start\nwith an alphabetical character and not contain any whitespace or parenthesis.\nToken* tokenize(char* in, int* ret_sz) {\n\tint cursor = 0;\n\tint sz = 0, alloc=1;\n\tToken* vec = (Token*) malloc(sizeof(Token));\n\n\twhile(in[cursor] != '\\0') {\n\n\t\tToken cur;\n\n\t\tif(in[cursor]=='(') {\n\t\t\tcur.type = TOKEN_OPEN;\n\t\t\tcursor++;\n\n\t\t} else if(in[cursor]==')') {\n\t\t\tcur.type = TOKEN_CLOSE;\n\t\t\tcursor++;\n\n\t\t} else if(isdigit(in[cursor])) {\n\t\t\tint number;\n\t\t\tsscanf(in+cursor,\"%d\",&amp;number);\n\n\n\t\t\twhile(in[cursor] != '\\0'\n\t\t\t\t  &amp;&amp; isdigit(in[cursor])) {\n\t\t\t\tcursor++;\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\tcur.type = TOKEN_NUMBER;\n\t\t\tcur.data.number = number;\n\t\t\tDEBUG(\"TOKEN_NUMBER: %d\\n\", number);\n\n\t\t} else if(isalpha(in[cursor])) {\n\n\t\t\tchar* name = (char*) malloc(MAX_SYM_SZ);\n\t\t\tassert(name!=NULL);\n\t\t\n\t\t\tint ptr = 0;\n\n\t\t\twhile(in[cursor] != '('\n\t\t\t\t  &amp;&amp; in[cursor] != ')'\n\t\t \t\t  &amp;&amp; in[cursor] != ' '\n\t\t\t\t  &amp;&amp; in[cursor] != '\\0')\n\t\t\t  {\n\n\t\t\t\tif(isalpha(in[cursor])) in[cursor] = toupper(in[cursor]);\n\t\t\t\tname[ptr] = in[cursor];\n\t\t\t\tptr++, cursor++;\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\tname[ptr] = '\\0';\n\n\t\t\tcur.type = TOKEN_SYMBOL;\n\t\t\tcur.data.name = name;\n\t\t\tDEBUG(\"TOKEN_NAME: %s\\n\", name);\n\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tcursor++;\n\t\t\tcontinue;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tif(alloc &lt;= sz+1) {\n\n\t\t\talloc *= 2;\n\t\t\tvec = (Token*) realloc(vec, sizeof(Token)*alloc);\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tDEBUG(\"TOKEN: %s\\n\", Token_Type_Str[cur.type]);\n\n\t\tvec[sz++] = cur;\n\t}\n\n\t*ret_sz = sz;\n\n\treturn vec;\n}\n\nAnd that's about it for the lexer.\nRepresenting S-Expressions\nBefore we start to implement the parser we need to write the data types for it.\nBut this time it is a little bit different because the parser will generate a\ndata structure which can be executed. We are going to represent those structures\nas lisp S-Expressions.\nFirst, let's define the type Lisp_Object, (it has nothing to do with OOP's\nobjects), which will represent everything that a cons cell can hold as its car\nor cdr.\nTagged Pointers\nThere are a few ways that we could choose to represent Lisp_Object, we are\ngoing to use tagged pointers, which are common in many Lisp implementations.\nEvery variable in C has at least 8 bits, so every valid pointer points to an\naddress which is a multiple of 8. This means that the least significant bits of\na valid address will aways end with three zeros. So we can use these bits to\nstore additional information about what the pointer is pointing to. When we need\nto deference it we just mask out those three bits.\nThey are useful because a pointer usually occupies eight bytes and an int or\nfloat just 4, so we can embed ints and floats into them, all we have to do is to\nshift them up three bits. That's a huge improvement over deferencing a pointer\nto an integer which is allocated on the heap. Using tagged pointers we can\nutilize ints and floats on the stack.\nNow, we will define a variable that will represent everything that a cons cell\ncan hold as its car and cdr: Lisp_Object.\ntypedef uintptr_t Lisp_Object;\n#define NIL (Lisp_Object)0;\n\nLisp_Object is a tagged pointer, that's why we used uintptr_t (it is\ndefined be a variable that can store a pointer). And now a few functions to\noperate on it.\nenum Tag {\n\tTAG_SYMBOL = 0,\n\tTAG_NUMBER = 1,\n\tTAG_CONS = 2\n\t/* ... */\n};\n\nLisp_Object ptr_tag(Lisp_Object obj, enum Tag tag) {\n\treturn obj | (int)tag;\n}\n\nLisp_Object ptr_untag(Lisp_Object obj) {\n\treturn obj &amp; ~((Lisp_Object) 7);\n}\n\nint ptr_getTag(Lisp_Object obj) {\n\treturn (int)(obj&amp;7);\n}\n\n\nThose are the basic operations that we are going to be doing with them. But now we\nneed a few helper functions and macros to help us create new objects.\n#define OBJ(val, type)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\\\n\tObj_New_ ## type (val)\n\nLisp_Object Obj_New_symbol(char* str) {\n\tchar* nstr = (char*) malloc(sizeof(str));\n\tstrcpy(nstr, str);\n\tLisp_Object ret = ptr_tag((Lisp_Object)nstr, TAG_SYMBOL);\n\n\treturn ret;\n}\n\nLisp_Object Obj_New_number(int val) {\n\tLisp_Object nval = val;\n\tnval = val&lt;&lt;3;\n\n\treturn ptr_tag(nval, TAG_NUMBER);\n}\n\ntypedef struct {\n\n\tLisp_Object car;\n\tLisp_Object cdr;\n\n}Lisp_Cons_Cell;\n\nLisp_Object fcons(Lisp_Object a, Lisp_Object b) {\n\tLisp_Cons_Cell* cell = (Lisp_Cons_Cell*) malloc(sizeof(Lisp_Cons_Cell));\n\tcell-&gt;car = a, cell-&gt;cdr = b;\n\n\treturn ptr_tag((Lisp_Object)&amp;cell, TAG_CONS);\n}\n\n\nOBJ is a little helper macro do help us create new objects. We use it like\nthis:\nLisp_Object a = OBJ(\"hello-there\", symbol);\nLisp_Object b = OBJ(42, number);\n\nI didn't write a Obj_New_cons because we will be using the fcons function to\ncreate new conses.\nPrinting S-Expressions\nBefore we start the parser itself we need to create a function to print\nS-Expressions, in order to debug it. There's an algorithm for it but I won't get\ninto detail. Here it is:\nvoid _Lisp_Print(Lisp_Object obj, int head);\n\nvoid Lisp_Print_cons(Lisp_Object obj, int head) {\n\tif(head) putchar('(');\n\n\t_Lisp_Print(fcar(obj), 1);\n\n\tif(ptr_untag(fcdr(obj))==NIL) {\n\t\tputchar(')');\n\t} else if(ptr_getTag(fcdr(obj))!=TAG_CONS) {\n\t\tprintf(\" . \");\n\t\t_Lisp_Print(fcdr(obj), 0);\n\t\tputchar(')');\n\t} else {\n\t\tputchar(' ');\n\t\t_Lisp_Print(fcdr(obj), 0);\n\t}\n}\n\n\nvoid _Lisp_Print(Lisp_Object obj, int head) {\n\tenum Tag tag = ptr_getTag(obj);\n\n\tswitch(tag) {\n\t\tcase TAG_NUMBER:\n\t\t\tprintf(\"%d\", GET_VAL(obj, number));\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\tcase TAG_SYMBOL:\n\t\t\tprintf(\"%s\", GET_VAL(obj, symbol));\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\tcase TAG_CONS:\n\t\t\tLisp_Print_cons(obj, head);\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t}\n}\n\n\nvoid Lisp_Print(Lisp_Object obj) {\n\t_Lisp_Print(obj, 1);\n\tputchar('\\n');\n}\n\n\nThe parser\nI really liked implementing a Lisp parser a for another interpreter a few days\nago, the algorithm is so simple!\nIf a S-Expression is a list, whe can think of it as a list of atoms and for each\natom we parse it recursively. So, how do we parse a simple list? This is how it\nwould like in ~~py~~pseudocode:\ndef parse (n):\n\tobj = get_obj(n)\n\n\tif obj == nil:\n\t\treturn obj\n\n\telse:\n\t\treturn cons(obj, parse(n+1))\n\nIt doesn't work for every S-Expression yet, but the main takeaway for it is that\nyou cons the current object with the rest of the list recursively. The only\ndifference between this and a complete parser is that the latter handles\nparenthesis by parsing what is inside the current block and consing it with the\nrest of the list.\nLisp_Object parse(Token* tokens, int pos, int sz) {\n\tif(pos==sz) return NIL; /* the stop condition */\n\n\tif(tokens[pos].type == TOKEN_OPEN) {\n\n\t\tLisp_Object car = parse(tokens,pos+1,sz);\n\n\t\tint aux = 1, balance = -1;\n\n\t\twhile(balance != 0) { /*  Looking for the matching ) */\n\n\t\t\tassert(aux+pos &lt; sz);\n\n\t\t\tif(tokens[pos+aux].type == TOKEN_OPEN)\n\t\t\t\tbalance--;\n\t\t\tif(tokens[pos+aux].type == TOKEN_CLOSE)\n\t\t\t\tbalance ++;\n\n\t\t\taux++;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tLisp_Object cdr = parse(tokens, pos+aux, sz);\n\n\t\treturn fcons(car, cdr);\n\n\t} else if(tokens[pos].type == TOKEN_CLOSE) {\n\n\t\treturn NIL;\n\n\t} else if(tokens[pos].type == TOKEN_NUMBER) {\n\n\t\tint n = tokens[pos].data.number;\n\t\tLisp_Object car = OBJ(n, number);\n\n\t\treturn fcons(car, parse(tokens, pos+1, sz));\n\n\t} else if(tokens[pos].type == TOKEN_SYMBOL) {\n\n\t\tchar* str = tokens[pos].data.name;\n\n\t\tLisp_Object car = OBJ(str, symbol);\n\t\treturn fcons(car, parse(tokens, pos+1, sz));\n\n\t}\n\n\treturn NIL;\n}\n\n\nThis code isn't that much different from the pseudocode that I've written\nbefore, the main difference is the parenthesis handling. The code for this\narticle can be seen\nhere.\nEvery cons and symbol in which we allocate are not fred, so our interpreter is\nleaking memory. The solution for this is called garbage collection, we are going\nto implement it in a latter article.\n","id":"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/mk-lisp-1/","title":"myLisp Interpreter 1: Lexer and Parser"},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/new-things-here/":{"body":"New things here\nHey there, this website has been through some changes recently.

But with\nportscanning is different, there are only (2^16) ports (65635), so why do we\nsay to only test a fraction of those?\nI've heard people say:\n\n\"It's hidden, when I run nmap it doesn't even show up!\"\n\nIt's not hidden, that just happens because nmap doesn't test all ports by\ndefault. I think you always should do so, we spend a lot of time running all\nsorts of tools, why are we so hasty when it comes to port scanning?\nA practical example\nI always check all the ports, and right now I'm using naabu + nmap with the\ncommand naabu -host HOST -p - -nmap-cli 'nmap -sV -oX nmap.xml'. naabu will\ncheck for all the open ports and then invoke nmap to enumerate the running\nservices in the found ports. The -sV option provided to nmap is very\nimportant, because it'll show us which kind and version of service is running\nin each port, documentation here.\nPORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION\n8002/tcp open  http    nginx 1.22.0\n\nThis is how the nmap version &amp; service enumeration output looks like.\nThe command above will spit out a nmap.xml file with that juicy data in xml\nformat. I find XML hard to work with, so I convert it to JSON using something\nlike xq.\nSome interesting idea would be to have a cronjob to run nmap once a day and\ndiff the results. There's a lot more that you can do with port scanning,\nspecially with a powerful tool like nmap and some good scripts. But as it is,\nthis is a good starting point.\n","id":"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/post-scanning-like-a-pro/","title":"Port Scanning like a Pro"},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/psychedelic-programming-languages/":{"body":"A bit of background\nI started programming to make simple webpages and Flash games. To me it was\nabout interacting with those systems, adding automation to them. Not long after\nthat I started coding robots with Arduino and it was still just that,\nautomating turning on a led, reading a value, writing something to a terminal,\netc.\nIt started to change when I discovered The Coding\nTrain, through that I started to\nsee, actually see how complex and amazing could be the things you did with\ncode. It was then that I started  to get concerned with abstractions, my code\ngrew bigger and everything was so messy! I needed some help. Processing is\nbased on Java which means the tools that I used to handle that complexity\nwere Functions, Classes and Methods, it was actually fun.\nAt the same time, I was part of a team making Arduino robots to compete. I\nquickly applied the tools that I learnt with Processing to Arduino, afterall\nthey're similar. I had no notion of state machines and agents, so the code was\na mess and it didn't work well. But, you know, all was good, I felt in control\nof the code, still very fun.\nDuring that time I met with some people that blew my mind my showing me how\n\"real programmign\" was like with C# and machine learning. I felt like I\nneeded to learn some real programming... and I wanted to code my own Dwarf\nFortress. I searched online, Dwarf Fortress was made in C++, Arduino was\nbased on C++ so it shouldn't be that hard, right? Right??  Well, I printed a\nC++ book, Jumping into C++ and ate it; it taught the basics of pointers,\nstructs, methods, classes and templates, it's a nice book.\nMaking games\nArmed with my fresh new C++ knowledge and the amazing LazyFoo's SDL\ntutorials, I was ready to tackle any 2D\ngame that I could think of.\nWhat is the game called you ask? 2dGame of\ncourse, why not? If you know something about C++, you already know that it\ndidn't work as I expected. Even though I grasped the language's syntax and\nbasic abstractions, even though I KNEW pointers there was some giant beast\nthat destroyed me, the RUNTIME.\nThere were segmentation faults all around, some predictable, some very\nunpredictable. The issue was that before my code interacted with a small domain\n(The flash engine, A small embedded system with Arduino helping me, the JVM\nwith Processing helping me) and now it interacted directly with the whole\ncomputer system, \"real programming\", or in fact, Systems Programming (I wish\nI knew that back then). Classes and methods didn't help me if I dont't\nunderstand the stack or the heap.\nHaving fun with Gophers\nI moved on to other things: Web programming in Go. When I discovered Go I felt\nthe same thing that I did when I started coding Processing. It was novel, fun,\nand powerful. Some things struck me as essential to Go's joy:\n\nHow simple it was.\nEasy parallelism.\nHow easy it was to use other peoples' code together with mine.\n\nDue to those things I was making games easily, and interacting with the web \nwith joy. I learnt a lot of things and had a great time, thanks Go.\nOne of the things was semantic versioning of dependencies. I love immutable\nthings, Go was creating some sort of global registry for all of those different\nversions and I got involved in some open source project related to it. It was\nvery little but it still felt nice.\nA lot of Systems Programming\nI can't recall why or how, but I started going back to Systems Programming, I\nlearnt the basics of Rust and understood why programming C++ was so hard back\nthen.\nI was making steady progress learning about systems and programming in C. I'd\nsay that was the most formative time for me in terms of how much effort I\ninvestest learning about programming and computers in general.\nI don't know why but I started reading Land of Lisp and it really did fuck me up.\nPsychedelic Programming Languages\nMy first trip\nCommon Lisp is a psychedelic programming language, and Land of Lisp really\ndid show that. \n\nIt's an\namazing book and it opened up my mind with Lisp. It presented itself in a very\n\"Look how amazing, cool, and different Lisp is!!\" it clicked for me. Now the\nwalls seemed to breathe and I love parenthesis man! It also opened up my mind\nto functional programming, that for a long time seemed to be only\nreserved to academics obsessed with proofs, purity and elegance(?).\nThis experience changed how I programmed and thought about programming. But I\nstill felt like the same Gabriel that breathed Systems Programming... but this\ntime a lot more confident in my programming skills. I decided to code a\nminecraft clone from scratch using only C++, SDL, and OpenGL. This time, I want\nto show the old Gabriel how good of a programmer I am now, how much I can do. I\nstill had some issues with the runtime, specially related to performance and\nallocations, but this time I was able to succeed\nsomewhat.\nMy second trip\nMy second psychedelic programming experience was not given by a book or\nsomething made by nature, but by this fella named Dan\nGrossman. He has a three part\ncourse in Coursera named, you guessed it, Programming Languages. He's like\na Programming Languages god and taught ML, Scheme, and Ruby in an amazing way.\nML is a psychedelic language. It opened my eyes to what a good type system is\ncapable of. Fuck C's,  C++'s fuck Java's and fuck Java. ML has a REAL type\nsystem. To me this really shows how powerful this experience was, when after it\nyou are fuck this fuck that I know better, fuck you. And ML gave me that.\nI guess I could've had that same experience from learning Haskell, but I never\nwas able to get into it, I guess it was just too... uptight, too square, too\nself conscious.\nThat course also taught me a lot of vocabulary and mechanisms to compare\nprogramming languages fairly. It made me look Rust with new eyes, like dude, it\nhas Sum Types, good Type Inference and all of those goodies. This time\nI fell in love for Rust, for real (that's funny because the course had nothing\nto do with it).\nI felt blessed by the Programming Languages teaching, I was watching long\ntheoretical Programming Languages youtube videos, reading papers, writing\ncompilers, oh boy. That second trip really got me well, it changed me deeply.\nHeck I even went to a conference (By luck that was 2020 and many important\nconferences were being conducted remotely, even for free) and got to ask\nquestions to important people related to Programming Languages history. I was\nin the same slack channel as Rich Hickey! isn't it crazy?\nWith some time my interests shifted a little from Systems Programming, those\nlanguages that by the time were already my old friends like C++ and Rust became\ntoo heavy, I'm not thinking about performance nor memory that much, so why are\nyou getting in the way?\nFinding your home\nMy third trip\nThis one wasn't as crazy as the other ones, it felt like searching and finding\nfor my own home. I came across the book Data Oriented\nProgramming by\nYehonathan Sharvit, it talked about the style of programming that's commonly\nadopted by Clojure programmers, they tend to focus on the data and\ntransformations to it.\nThings should be simpler, data organized only as plain data. Arrays, maps,\ntuples. Functions transform data (never mutate it) and worry about the\nruntime later.\n\nThat's Clojure's way (it even has two differents runtimes) and I feel like\nthat's also the Data Oriented Programming way. Elixir also fit in this niche\npretty nicely. So this time it's not even a just Programming Language, it's a\nmix of a Programming Paradigm, a Language, and a Runtime.\nI even feel somewhat disconnected from that old Systems Programmer Gabriel,\nwe're not the same person. My head is so tuned to programming this way now.\nClojure is a psychedelic programming language . Of course I still face some\nproblems, but they're different and better now.\nFinal thoughts\nThat's what I wanted to say with this blogpost, how some experiences with\nProgramming feel so much Psyschedelic. They change the way\nyou think permanently, that they may feel even religious, they're powerful.\nProgramming Languages, ideas about Programming in general can be crazy, very\nphilosophical, and practical at the same time. I think most of them should be\ngiven a chance, they may change you.\nThanks for reading. Hope you had a good time.\n","id":"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/psychedelic-programming-languages/","title":"Psychedelic Programming Languages"},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/when-things-are-too-smart/":{"body":"The Perpetrator\nThis bad boy here, he's too smart.\n\nI bought it in Israel for about 70 NIS, it was a good deal.\nI was really happy with this purchase and it had served me well for a long time.\nI recently got back to the hobby of making hardware projects. I have a tiny power supply that has an USB port and this Power Bank would connect to it and power what is connected to the power supply. It would work really well because this powerbank has a capacity of 10,000mAh, so I thought.\nThe issue\nThe thing is, when connected to an Arduino Nano the powerbank works for about 10 seconds and then shuts off. Inicially I thought that it had to do with the power supply not handling the power output or something, but then after a little research I realized what was going on.\nIt's just too smart!\nIt shuts off because it detects too little current, so it thinks \"Just 10mA? Well, my job here is done, I'll sleep now\" and shuts off.\nSo, I thought about doing a lobotomy and making it dumber, but c'mon, poor little guy, he's just trying to be helpful.\nThe solution\nThe solution  is simple: Make it  work harder, this way it won't think it has fully charged something and will never sleep.\nWe want it to draw more current and not disturb the rest of the circuit, thus we connect a load in parallel from the GND to VCC. The additional current it'll draw will be V/R, where V is the power supply's voltage and R is the resistance of our load.\nThe least resistive resistor that I have is a 330Ohm one, so a single Resistor in parallel would draw 5v/330Ohm = 15.1mA. So through the methods of an advanced technique called trial and error I discoreved that four 330Ohm resistors do the job.\nHere is what it looks like.\n\nConclusion\nMaybe there's a moral to this story, like: \n\n\"Tinkerers have to expect to tinker more than what they think they'll tinker\"\n\nor like:\n\n\"Don't use stuff to do what it wasn't inteded to\"\n\nBut I can't find any.

The pacing is way slower compared to the first book, and in some way it executes it nicely, going into more detail about each character and how the events happened. It makes sense too, because this book marks a huge turning point in the story, that happens very quickly, hence the change of pacing.\nThat said, I think it loses some of the novelty from the first one and it seldom gave me a deep insight like the first one did. I fell that I have to finish the Second Foundation to make my mind about this book and put it into perspective. But for now I give it a ok out of meh rating, as compared to the first one, that (to me) is much more interesting as it presents many new concepts and ideas that aren't built upon in Foundation and Empire.\n","id":"https://gbrls.github.io/books/foundation-and-empire-asimov/","title":"Foundation and Empire - Isaac Asimov"},"https://gbrls.github.io/books/foundation-asimov/":{"body":"This was my first Asimov book and my first Sci-fi book at all.\nI expected a book about how the future, about how technology will change the way we live, etc.\nBut it was very different, not in a bad way. \nI soon realized that one of the powerful things about Sci-fi\nis that the author can talk about historical facts in a new light. \ne.g: Asimov talks about the fall of empires without talking directly about anything that existed (like the Roman Empire),\nthis means that we as the reader can have new views about it, untaited by our previous conceptions.\nTech is portrayed in the book basically like the 1950's, but more powerful. \nThe informational era never reached that universe, a universe were there's an empire that controls a whole Galaxy.\nDespite this, they have public phones with video, people deliver messages by phone, by letters, by tv, or by just going into one's room and talking to them.\nThat public phone with video calling capabilities made me chuckle.\nI believe that Asimov didn't think that our relationship with technology would change the way it did, but he foresaw something very interesting.\nIn the books, there's an organization (The Foundation) that is trying to eventually dominate the whole galaxy.\nThere's a point in the story that they are the most technologically advanced society in their region and they use that power to control their neighbours and\nthey make them rely on their technology without teaching them how it works. This strategy worked really well for them.\nI can't help but link that to our relationship with Computers and the Internet. This whole mobile/social media transformation came in a fast wave,\nmost people are imersed in it, but it came so fast that they couldn't learn about how it works, and this is scary. It's scary because whomever controls the tech \nhas an disproportionate amout of control agains who uses it.\nThe main point of the book is about the fall of Empires, and this is a thing that I think a lot about.\nAs a Programmer and Computer Engineering student I often think about the many different systems that are the backbone of our computing technology and how very few people know how to build them.\nIt's not common anymore to design new computer architectures, to design new operating systems and new programming paradigms.\nThis means that with time, people will care less and less about how to build those systems and will only care how to use them.\nThis happened in the Foundation's universe (it was one of the causes of their downfall) and I fear this will happen to us too.\nThis is why I think it is still very important to learn, teach and build (maybe just as an exercise) the fundamentals of our computing infrastructure, despite most people only needing to know how to operate them.\nAs my grandpa always says:\n\n\"Every single company will one day fail.\"\n\nSometimes he sounds like Hari Seldom, I hope he's wrong about this one.\nWell, my goal is to to help avoid or postpone this (maybe inevitable) fall, by injecting new inovations in the systems that are the backbone of our world.\n","id":"https://gbrls.github.io/books/foundation-asimov/","title":"Foundation - Isaac Asimov"},"https://gbrls.github.io/books/foundations-edge/":{"body":"Intro\nThis book was released almost thirty years after \"Second Foundation\", which was the latest book in the story's chronology.\nMany things in the original trilogy that I wasn't really happy with or that were a bit \"outdated\" are addressed in this book.\nAsimov's brilliance\nOne of the things that I like the most about Asimov's writing is that he's interested in many different things and this knowlege really shows in his books.\nIn the first trilogy it's possible to see his interest in Roman history, mathematics, and his experience in the academic life. e.g. The Sack of Trantor in really similar the Sack of Rome, there are many many more similarities to Roman History.\nOne thing that I really missed in the first trilogy was the advancement of the computing and communication technology.\nComputers\nThe years that divided the release of \"Second Foudation\" and \"Foundation's Edge\" were full of huge technological advancements in the eletronics and computing industry.\nI think when Mayor Branno talks how Seldom couldn't forsee the technological advancements that happened in the Foundation, Asimov was in a way talking to himself. \nThere's a point in the story were Trevize first uses the Far Star's computer and it's trully amazing. The computer extends his intelligence and his physical capabilities, if he thinks \"What's the time now?\" then he just knows it, if he is visualizing a geometry, he can just see it phisically.\nIt seems so obvious but I never thought about a Brain-Computer interface like this before. This passage made me obsessed with this concept and I started\nresearching about Intelligence Augmentation, Artificial Intelligence Augmentation, and Tools for Thought.\nConclusion\nThis is an amazing book and it has many more interesting facets. I think it shows that an interested mind produces very interesting things.

Mankind can never evolve the ability of control of it's future because it'll always take the safest and most mediocre path, and this will eventually lead to self destruction (by depression basically). \nTo achieve greatness there must be trouble, hard times and randomness.\nThe Eternity itself\t\nThe eternity is also shown as a very abrasive and hostile organization, where people detached from their times work in the whole eternity like it's their own toy. In some ways it seems almost like a military organization. There's a passage where Noys speaks to Harlan that everybody in eternity is an psychopath and he remembers that someone he knew despite being basically mentaly broken in his training made important decisions inside the organization, this came across to me as very realistic, it's that kind of truth that hurts a little to just know it.\nThe chast system that exists in eternity also shows this sick nature of their organization, they discount their grief of not having a past, of their memories never existed in the inferior chasts. How it's expected that their morality is any better than nothing? Spaceships are bad because they lead to high drug use, and nuclear technology is bad because it's too risky. Asimov even talks about the lower chast, the Maintenence, their are the largest chast in number are are problably the chast that have the most well rounded people because \"their hobbies aren't expcted to be related to their work activities\", I think it's kind of funny that Asimov talks about this because this thing about being interested in different things is one of the things that I believe makes him a great writer ([[Different areas of Interest | more]]).\nQuotes\n\n\"Out of danger and restless insecurity comes the force that pushes mankind to newer and loftier conquests\"\n\n\"In a system [...] which allows men to choose their own future, will end by choosing safety and mediocrity\"\n\n![[eoe1.png]]\n\n![[eoe2.png]]\n\n\ntags: #digest/book\nlinks: [[Asimov]]\nfinished: 16 sept 2021\n","id":"https://gbrls.github.io/books/the-end-of-eternity-asimov/","title":"The End of Eternity - Isaac Asimov"},"https://gbrls.github.io/gallery/":{"body":"","id":"https://gbrls.github.io/gallery/","title":""},"https://gbrls.github.io/projects/":{"body":"Projects\nCurrent and past projects.\n\nSecurity tools\npentrop\n\nCLI tool which calculates the shannon entropy of the given data.\n\nLamaList\n\nCollection of security focused wordlists in brazillian portuguese.\n\n\nMisc\naction-dropbox-download\n\nGithub Action to download files from Dropbox.\n\n","id":"https://gbrls.github.io/projects/","title":"Projects Portfolio"},"https://gbrls.github.io/todo/":{"body":"todo\n\nConfigure local development with Dropbox.\n\n","id":"https://gbrls.github.io/todo/","title":"todo"}},"docInfo":{"https://gbrls.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://gbrls.github.io/about-here/":{"body":60,"title":1},"https://gbrls.github.io/about-me/":{"body":26,"title":0},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/":{"body":3,"title":1},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/binbin-tree/":{"body":138,"title":3},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/c-gems-homoiconicity-in-c/":{"body":590,"title":4},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/current-organizational-structure/":{"body":193,"title":3},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/getting-hands-dirty-with-hacking/":{"body":639,"title":4},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/hello-world/":{"body":39,"title":2},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/making-and-writing-games/":{"body":277,"title":3},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/mk-lisp-0/":{"body":451,"title":4},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/mk-lisp-1/":{"body":837,"title":5},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/new-things-here/":{"body":58,"title":3},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/obi2018-baldes/":{"body":319,"title":4},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/obi2018-bolas/":{"body":81,"title":4},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/obi2018-cinco/":{"body":79,"title":4},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/obi2018-maximin/":{"body":72,"title":4},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/obi2018-muro/":{"body":94,"title":4},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/pinging-servers-from-recife/":{"body":36,"title":3},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/post-scanning-like-a-pro/":{"body":222,"title":3},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/psychedelic-programming-languages/":{"body":783,"title":3},"https://gbrls.github.io/blog/when-things-are-too-smart/":{"body":178,"title":2},"https://gbrls.github.io/books/":{"body":9,"title":1},"https://gbrls.github.io/books/forward-the-foundation-asimov/":{"body":0,"title":4},"https://gbrls.github.io/books/foundation-and-earth/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://gbrls.github.io/books/foundation-and-empire-asimov/":{"body":77,"title":4},"https://gbrls.github.io/books/foundation-asimov/":{"body":266,"title":3},"https://gbrls.github.io/books/foundations-edge/":{"body":172,"title":4},"https://gbrls.github.io/books/homo-deus-harari/":{"body":0,"title":5},"https://gbrls.github.io/books/israel-a-concise-history-of-a-nation-reborn/":{"body":0,"title":5},"https://gbrls.github.io/books/prelude-to-foundation-asimov/":{"body":106,"title":4},"https://gbrls.github.io/books/ra/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://gbrls.github.io/books/rama/":{"body":0,"title":5},"https://gbrls.github.io/books/second-foundation-asimov/":{"body":0,"title":4},"https://gbrls.github.io/books/secrets-of-the-autistic-millionaire/":{"body":42,"title":3},"https://gbrls.github.io/books/the-end-of-eternity-asimov/":{"body":206,"title":4},"https://gbrls.github.io/gallery/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://gbrls.github.io/projects/":{"body":30,"title":2},"https://gbrls.github.io/todo/":{"body":5,"title":1}},"length":39},"lang":"English"};
