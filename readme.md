# gbrls.github.io

This the repository for my personal website.

##  Processes

This website is built using [hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) (for now).

Right now I'm in the process of restructuring this repo and how I build the website.

The goal is to integrate the github pages deployment with my PKMS that's hosted on dropbox.
